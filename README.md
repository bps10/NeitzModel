#NeitzModel

*A collection of scripts for simulating and visualizing Neitz theories on color perception and emmetropization.*

##color

This module contains scripts to simulate:

1. color perception as predicted in the Neitz theory, and
2. color spaces from spectral sensitivity functions derived by either Carroll, McMahon, Neitz, Neitz 2000 or Stockman & Sharpe 2000.

##emmetrop(ization)

This module simulates the activity of a single cone photoreceptor
